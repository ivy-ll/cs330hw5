# Credit Card Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a self-directed assignment for UBC's Applied Machine Learning course (CPSC 330). The goal of the project was to practice machine learning fundamentals through working on a large dataset from Kaggle. My partner and I built and evaluated machine learning models to predict whether a credit card client will default on their payment. The dataset used for this task contained approximately 30,000 examples and 24 features.

### Overview
In this project, we followed the fundamental machine learning pipeline, including **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data splitting**, **cross-validation**, and **model evaluation**. We worked with the dataset using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**, applying multiple classification models to predict credit card default. The models tested include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performed data cleaning, handling of missing values, and scaling of numerical features.
- **Modeling**: Evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and RBF SVM, to predict default payments.
- **Cross-Validation**: Applied cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
- **Evaluation**: Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
