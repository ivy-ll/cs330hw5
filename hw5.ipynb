    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "In this mini project, you have the option to choose on which dataset you will be working on. The tasks you will need to carry on will be similar, independently of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "You can choose to work on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. \n",
    "For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "You can choose to work on a regression problem using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) of New York City Airbnb listings from 2019. As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset, then you will try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note there is an updated version of this dataset with more features available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/). The features were are using in `listings.csv.gz` for the New York city datasets. You will also see some other files like `reviews.csv.gz`. For your own interest you may want to explore the expanded dataset and try your analysis there. However, please submit your results on the dataset obtained from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the options and pick the one you find more interesting (it may help spending some time looking at the documentation available on Kaggle for each dataset).\n",
    "2. After making your choice, focus on understanding the problem and what each feature means, again using the documentation on the dataset page on Kaggle. Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",
    "3. Download the dataset and read it as a pandas dataframe. "

    "The **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset** is a classification problem that determines whether or not a credit card client will default next month. We expected (and found) that most of the features would be numerical, since they deal with the financial sector. The data set is quite large and expansive, consisting of 30,000 examples and 24 features. We noticed an interesting subset of the features, `PAY_X`, `BILL_AMTX`, and `PAY_AMTX`. Each column in the `PAY`, `BILL_AMT` and `PAY_AMT` sets had the same semantic meaning, but `X` referred to which month it corresponded to. The entries in this dataset were collected over the period of April to December 2005. Our initial exploration and real-world understanding of the problem identified _credit limits_, _amounts paid_, and _payment delay_ as possible key predictors for our model.  "

    "- **No missing data**: all columns contain 30,000 non-null values.\n",
    "- **Financial variables**: The LIMIT_BAL, PAY, PAY_AMT, and BILL_AMT columns represent financial sums. They have large ranges and have high standard deviation. This implies that diverse payment behavior exists across the data set. \n",
    "- **Categorical variables**: SEX, EDUCATION, and MARRIAGE are categorical variables which were encoded as numeric in the columns of the data set. Some of these columns contain ambiguous entries (ex. 0 or 5) that may need to be encoded as an \"other\" category during preprocessing.\n",
    "- **Class imbalance**: There is roughly a 78:22 class imbalance between the non-default (0) and default (1) classes. This suggests that some adjustments _might_ be necessary to prevent the model from being biased towards predicting the majority class.\n",

    "After examining our findings and the wider context of the problem, we chose to focus on the following scoring metrics, ranked below in order of priority:\n",
    "1. **Recall**: Minimizing false positives, predicting that a client will _not default (0)_ when they actually _default (1)_. False positives can be incredibly costly for financial institutions, as they could potentially lose large sums of money by failing to correctly identify a defaulter. Since the defaulter has already incurred costs on their behalf, such costs should be minimized as much as possible to offset losses.\n",
    "2. **Precision**: Minimizing false negatives, predicting that a client will _default (1)_ when they actually _do not default (0)_. We reasoned that false negatives were much less costly, since the institution misses out on potential gains (i.e denying credit to customers who can actually pay) but do not incur any losses by doing so, which is ultimately better for its financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other metrics of interest were the **F1-score** (since precision and recall are fairly important in this case), and the **ROC AUC curve** (since our dataset is slightly imbalanced, so it would be useful to visualize the performance of the model across thresholds)."

    "Our biggest takeaway from the machine learning material so far is that success in machine learning does not come from the model alone. Earlier in the course, we learned that the foundations of machine learning lie in these machines' abilities to learn from data through repeated cycles of training and testing. Despite this, we learn about multiple ways to optimize and fine-tune this process to point our model in the right direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thoroughly understanding the data deeply before diving into model training is extremely important. It involves exploring and analyzing the data to understand its structure and distribution. Supervised learning models are only as good as the data they’re trained on, so spending time on preprocessing is critical to ensuring that the model is learning meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another insight is the value of feature engineering. Machine learning models don’t inherently know which features are the most important or the most relevant to the target variable, so it's up to us to decide which features to include. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization has also been a significant part of building effective models. Different algorithms have different parameters that control model behavior. Tuning these parameters through these techniques allows us to fine-tune the model's complexity and avoid underfitting or overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Succeeding in machine learning requires a combination of a multitude of conscientious choices made by the model builder, which requires both technical skill and critical thinking to make sure our models are not only accurate but also generalizable and reliable in real-world applications."
